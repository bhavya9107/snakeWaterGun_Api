### What were some of the trade-offs or struggles you faced when implementing the new game logic?


First of all ,thinking about implementing this game with some new features was bit tricky.

In order to ensure the game logic and each endpoint is working properly, I had to
repeatedly create new users, play a few games and hope to get the result I need (result is random).

It becomes trivial and frustrating at times, I should probably automate the testing process
at the beginning to make it more efficient.
